# Problem Statement
AI for Grievance Redressal in Public Governance

Public governance bodies receive thousands of citizen grievances every day related to civic infrastructure, sanitation, public safety, utilities, healthcare, education, and administrative delays.  
These complaints are usually unstructured (free-text), manually reviewed, and slowly routed, leading to delayed resolution, backlog, lack of accountability, and citizen dissatisfaction.  
There is a strong need for an AI-driven system that can automatically understand, prioritise, and route grievances to enable faster and more transparent governance.

## Project Overview
The AI-Powered Grievance Redressal System is a web-based application designed to help public governance authorities manage citizen complaints efficiently.  
The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to analyse unstructured grievances, assign explainable priority levels, and automatically route complaints to the appropriate departments.

Safety-critical complaints such as accidents or emergencies are deterministically prioritised and escalated to ensure immediate attention.  
An admin dashboard provides real-time visibility into complaint volume and high-priority cases, improving decision-making and response time.
